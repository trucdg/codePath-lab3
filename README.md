## Unit 3 Lab: ☕ On My Grind
## 🎈 Overview
Have you ever wanted to work at Starbucks? You’re about to be one step closer. In this app inspired by Wordle, memorize coffee drink recipes and quiz yourself on a random real (and possibly discontinued 😉) Starbucks drink’s temperature, flavor, milk type, and blendedness. The app will let you know if you’re a natural at barista-ing.

## 🎈 Required feature

Quiz, quiz, quiz! In the required features for this project, you will have a form with multiple choice inputs that can be selected and their values will populate the answer box above them. Then when submitted, the answer boxes will turn red if the answers placed there are incorrect and purple if the answers are correct. Can you handle the Starbucks drink station at an 8 am rush?
